# Graph-Coloring-Variants

In this project, we will explore list coloring, a common variant of vertex coloring of graphs. We begin with an introduction to list coloring, with definitions and some examples. We then establish the list version of Brooks’ Theorem and show how this implies Brooks’ Theorem in the standard vertex coloring setting. Finally, we introduce correspondence coloring as a way to generalize list coloring further.
